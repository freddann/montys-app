# Monty Hall Simulation
A small react web app which simulates the Monty Hall problem:

"Assume that you are attending a TV show where you can win money by picking the right box. The game show host shows you three boxes explaining that the money is in one of the boxes. He asks you to pick one of them without opening it. After you have picked one of the boxes he opens one of the other two boxes which is empty. Now he turns to you and asks, do you want to change your mind, picking the remaining box?"

## Installation
- install node if you haven't
- run `npm install`
- run `npm run dev` to start the webpack-dev-server
- connect your browser to `localhost:4000`
